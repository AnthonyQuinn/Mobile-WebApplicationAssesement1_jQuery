Assessment Brief in detail

You will be using the Mobile jQuery library to build a list style mobile web app. Your list will be generated from a JSON file that you will need to source from the web or hand code. Suggestions on useful free online data sources will be offered throughout the course. Your approach should be modular enough that replacing the JSON with similarly formed data will still allow the code to function (i.e. assuming the data has a defined structure). You can make your site/app about anything that interests you. For example, you might want to do a movie reviews app, a restaurant picker, a video jukebox, etc.

The app should incorporate the following features:

    Based on Mobile jQuery

    Present the user with an input box to filter the full list

    Use your own customized theme (ThemeRoller is fine but feel free to do something yourself if you prefer)

    Customize some of the default components, e.g. buttons, etc.

    Clicking on any list item (regardless of whether it is in the full or the filtered list) should use some

    page transition to present a "page" with extra content specific to that item.

    Use only one single HTML file for the main content and functionality

    Assume that your app could be wired up to some server side data feed, but build it using mockup

    client side content (i.e. clearly indicate, in your comments, the portions of the code that you think should be dynamic if the app were using live data).

    A collapsible side panel with some info about your app, e.g. usage instructions or something similar.

Please Note:

Files should be order in a sensible hierarchy and zipped together into a single file for submission, and please follow the correct naming conventions. All code files should be correctly labelled, and reused code must state the source of the material deployed, using inline comments.

Learning Outcomes:

By completing this assessment, you will learn to:

    Understand how to organize client side file sets and incorporate third party libraries.

    Understand how to include files into your app.

    Become familiar with UX considerations.

    Work with JSON data.

    Recognize and implement best practices for Mobile platform development.
